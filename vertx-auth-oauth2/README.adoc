# Vert.x OAuth2 Auth

Please see the documentation for more information.

## Running test

There is a Keycloak Docker image available, that you can load with the provided configuration `src/test/fixtures/vertx-test-realm.json`

```
docker run -d --rm --name keycloak -p 8888:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_USER=user -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=password -e DB_VENDOR=H2 jboss/keycloak
```

But you can simply run `mvn test`, since the Keycloak responses are mocked with a Web Server started in the test setup.


### IntelliJ IDE

In IntelliJ IDE, you have to uncheck `argLine` in Preferences -> Build,Execution,Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven -> Running Tests ...

to avoid `IntelliJ Error when running unit test: Could not find or load main class ${surefireArgLine}`
